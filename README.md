# heph
This project is the orchestration platform for the 'heph'. It provides a 5-stage Streamlit UI and the state management logic required to guide a user from initial prompt to final code review. It acts as a client to a separate backend service that handles the core AI generation tasks, creating a seamless and guided user experience.
